\maketitle[titletotopverticalspace=1in]
\centering

\begin{columns}
    \column{0.3}
    \block{\nth{1} Column}{

    You can have \textbf{however many} columns as you want, and
    you can make them \textbf{whatever widths} you want.
    You can even have columns within columns.

    \vspace{1em}

    You should take this document as a \textbf{starting point}, if you take it at all.
    It's no good if everyone copies this layout, pastes in their text, and goes off to the printers.
    It's worth thinking for a minute or two about if you want the poster in thirds, or half-half, or what.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    To change the width of a column, change the value for \texttt{\textbackslash column\{0.3\}} (30\% of the width of the page) to something else (like \texttt{\textbackslash column\{0.4\}} for 40\% or \texttt{\textbackslash column\{0.62312\}} for 62.312\%). Just try to get the columns to add up to 1.0.


    }

    \blindtext[1]

    {\scshape Don't get too close to margins.

    No, seriously. There's nothing but trouble here.}

    \column{0.45}
    \block{\nth{3} Column}{
        You can have some formulas if you want:

        \begin{align*} q^{-3} & \le \frac{\overline{\sqrt{2}-\emptyset}}{\tilde{\omega} \left( e, \dots, \frac{1}{P ( A )} \right)} \wedge p \left( \bar{K}^{-5}, \tilde{m} \right) \\ & = \max_{B \to \emptyset}  1 \pm \dots \cup \pi \left(-q ( d ), \dots, \mathscr{{C}}'' \right)  \\ & \le \left\{ 1^{-7} \colon \cosh^{-1} \left(-\kappa \right) \le \max \int_{\hat{M}} \tanh \left( C^{5} \right) \,d \theta \right\} \\ & \le \prod  \cosh^{-1} \left( \pi^{-8} \right) + \dots \vee \omega \left(-\pi, \infty \sqrt{2} \right) \end{align*}

        You can also have a figure:
        
        \vspace{1em}
        \begin{tikzfigure}[Here's where captions go. Captions are good.]
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{example-image}

    I think you're getting the idea.

    % But you can also do a colored box of text.

    Be sure to thank people who made the work you did possible --- specifically, funding sources, people and organizations who provided data, etc\dots

    There's no need to acknowledge your collaborators (the people you list at the top of the poster), because their contribution is being acknowledged in the form of co-authorship.

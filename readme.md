# readme pls

*First off, thanks to Blair Rossetti for [the template][Emory Template] I took and turned into this repository.*

This is a pretty basic (in both the formal and casual senses) poster template for people who kinda just want something that's "not objectionably bad". If you'd like to help make it less objectionably bad, please feel free to file an issue or make a pull request or something.

There are a lot of norms that you'll want to be aware of - things like:

- poster aspect ratio and size (what's typical for your field?)
- author order
- layout (2 column? 3? 6? Just kidding I've never seen 6 columns)
- ???

So, as stated, this is just a starting point. Take it and make it your own. It's my hope that things like column widths, numbers, etc... are pretty easy to work with, but if you encounter issues, please let me know (either contact me or file a GitHub issue!)

If you encounter something that you're not sure what to do about, and especially if there might be a norm to the answer (like "what's the right order for authors"), be sure to talk with your advisor(s), peers, or preferred search engine about it if you're not 100% sure. I promise, **it's less awkward to ask before you get a poster printed than it is to ask afterwards**.

# readme pls

*First off, thanks to Blair Rossetti for [the template][Emory Template] I took and turned into this repository.*

This is a pretty basic (in both the formal and casual senses) poster template for people who kinda just want something that's "not objectionably bad". If you'd like to help make it less objectionably bad, please feel free to file an issue or make a pull request or something.

There are a lot of norms that you'll want to be aware of - things like:

- poster aspect ratio and size (what's typical for your field?)
- author order (Often the person making the poster is "first", at least for the poster; does the professor go last? Does your immediate mentor (often a PhD student)? Check! **It's less awkward to ask before you get it printed!**)
- layout (2 column? 3? 6? Just kidding I've never seen 6 columns)
- ???

So, as stated, this is just a starting point. Take it and make it your own. It's my hope that things like column widths, numbers, etc... are pretty easy to work with, but if you dig into the repository and you can't make out up from down, please let me know!
